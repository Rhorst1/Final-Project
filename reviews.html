<h3>Barbara</h3>

        "Today, I wasn't feeling very motivated to work out. But I pushed myself to come to the gym and the staff were so welcoming! The minute I walked in the door, they said hi to me and they even knew my name! You can tell they really care about their customers here! I will be back in a couple of days to work out again and see my new friends!" - Barbara

<h3>Joan</h3>

    "Today, I was so tired after working out. I stepped into the relaxation location and immediately felt relief! It's so wonderful in there, the sound machines, the massage chairs, the sauna. It's exactly where I want to be after a hard workout!" - Joan
